<!--Goals: 
		1. Make it a fun experience with action tied to it, like Someecards. While it's fun to brows the SomeEcards cards, the goal of visiting the site is the *action* of sending a card to someone. Rather than being a text editor, it would be fun to make this the kind of place where people pull jokes on their friends...a punny way to send a regular old email. Like a practical joke.

		2. Virality: build into the email the pwned experience - link back to pwned to reply to the email (could it even auto-reply). 

		3. Can we make it *really* look like a practical joke by having the email send as if it was sent with the person's provider? Like Helpscout does - just use plain text. Give people the shock value the first time that their friend *really did* put time an effort into making a pun-worthy email
